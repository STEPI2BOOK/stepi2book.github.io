            <p align="left"><strong>Spatio-Temporal Methods in Environmental
              Epidemiology</strong> is the first book of its kind to specifically address
              the interface between environmental epidemiology and
              spatio-temporal modeling. In response to the growing need for
              collaboration between statisticians and environmental
              epidemiologists, the book links recent developments in
              spatio-temporal methodology with epidemiological applications.
              Drawing on real-life problems, it provides the tools required to
              exploit advances in methodology when assessing the health risks
              associated with environmental hazards. Clear guidelines are given
              to enable the implementation of methodology and estimation of
              risks in practice. </p>
            <p align="left"> Designed for graduate students in both
              epidemiology and statistics, the text covers a wide range of
              topics, from an introduction to epidemiological principles and the
              foundations of spatio-temporal modeling to new directions for
              research. It describes traditional and Bayesian approaches and
              presents the theory of spatial, temporal, and spatio-temporal
              modeling in the context of its application to environmental
              epidemiology .The text includes practical examples together with
              embedded R code and details of specific R packages and the use of
              other software including WinBUGS/OpenBUGS and INLA. Online
              resources associated with the book provide additional code, data,
              examples, exercises, lab projects, and more. </p>
            <p align="left"> Representing a major new direction in
              environmental epidemiology, this book—in full color
              throughout—underscores the increasing need to consider
              dependencies in both space and time when modeling epidemiological
              data.. Students will learn how to identify and model patterns in
              spatio-temporal data and to exploit dependencies over both space
              and time in order to reduce bias and inefficiency. </p>
            <p align="left"> From this book the reader will have gained an
              understanding of the following topics:</p>
            <ul, type="shape," align="left">
              <li>The basic concepts of epidemiology and the estimation of risks
                associated with environmental hazards.</li>
              <li>Hierarchical modelling with a Bayesian framework. </li>
              <li>The theory of spatial, temporal and spatio--temporal process
                needed for environmental health risk analysis.</li>
              <li>Fundamental questions related to the nature and role of
                uncertainty in environmental epidemiology and methods which may
                help answer those questions.</li>
              <li>Important areas of application within environmental
                epidemiology together with strategies for building the models
                that are needed and coping with challenges that arise.</li>
              <li>Methods and software for the analysis and visualisation of
                environmental and health. Examples of R and WinBUGS code are
                given throughout the book and, together with data for the
                examples the code, are included in the online resources. </li>
              <li>Offer a variety of exercises, both theoretical and practical,
                to assist in the development of the skills needed to perform
                spatio--temporal analyses.</li>

	            <h2><strong>Chapter 3: The importance of uncertainty</strong></h2>
				<hr style="background:#83d3c9; border:0; height:1px" />
                <p align="left">This chapter contains a discussion of uncertainty,

                  <li>Uncertainty can be dichotomised as either qualitative or quantitative, 
					  with the former allowing consideration of a wide variety of sources of 
					  uncertainty that would be difficult, if not impossible, to quantify 
					  mathematically. </li>
                  <li> Quantitative uncertainty can be thought of as comprising both aleatory 
					  and epistemic components, the former representing stochastic uncertainty 
					  and the latter subjective uncertainty.</li>
                  <li>Methods for assessing uncertainty including eliciting prior information 
					  from experts and sensitivity analysis.</li>
                  <li>Indexing quantitative uncertainty using the variance and entropy of the

					  Understanding uncertainty is therefore a vital feature of modern environmental 
					  epidemiology.</li>
                </ul,>
				<p></p>
				
						
	            <h2><strong>Chapter 4: Embracing uncertainty: the Bayesian approach</strong></h2>

				  <li>How preferential sampling can bias the measurements that arise from environmental 
					  monitoring networks.</li>
                </ul,>
				<p></p>
				
				
	            <h2><strong>Chapter 8: Spatial patterns in disease</strong></h2>
				<hr style="background:#83d3c9; border:0; height:1px" />

					spatial lattice processes and models for performing smoothing of risks over space. 
					From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics:</p>
                <ul, type="shape," align="left">
				  <li>Disease mapping, where we have seen how to improve estimates of risk by borrowing strength

				<hr style="background:#83d3c9; border:0; height:1px" />
				<p align="left">In this chapter we have seen the many ways in which the time can be added 
					to space in order to characterise random exposure fields. From this chapter, the reader 
					will have gained an understanding of the following topics:</p>
                <ul, type="shape," align="left">
				  <li>Additional power that can be gained in an epidemiological study by combining the 
					  contrasts in the process over both time and space while characterising the stochastic 
					  dependencies across both space and time for inferential analysis.</li>
				  <li>Criteria that good approaches to spatio–temporal modelling should satisfy.</li>
				  <li>General strategies for developing such approaches.</li>
				  <li>Separability and non-separability in spatio–temporal models, and how these could be 
					  characterised using the Kronecker product of correlation matrices.</li>
				  <li>Examples of the use of spatio–temporal models in modelling environmental exposures.</li>
                </ul,>

					other sources of bias</strong></h2>
			    <hr style="background:#83d3c9; border:0; height:1px" />
				<p align="left">This chapter contains a discussion of the differences between causality and 
					association. It also covers specific issues that may be encountered in this area when 
					investigating the effects of environmental hazards on health. From this chapter, the 
					reader will have gained an understanding of the following topics:</p>
                <ul, type="shape," align="left">
				  <li>Issues with causality in observational studies.</li>
				  <li>The Bradford–Hill criteria which are a group of minimal conditions necessary to 
					  provide adequate evidence of a causal relationship.</li>
				  <li>Ecological bias which may occur when inferences about the nature of individuals 
					  are made using aggregated data.</li>
				  <li>The role of exposure variability in determining the extent of ecological bias.</li>
				  <li>Approaches to acknowledging ecological bias in ecological studies.</li>
				  <li>Concentration and exposure response functions.</li>
				  <li>Models for estimating personal exposures including micro-environments.</li>
                </ul,>

				<hr style="background:#83d3c9; border:0; height:1px" />
				<p align="left">This chapter looks at the emergence of a central purpose; to explore or reduce 
					uncertainty about aspects of the 
					environmental processes of interest. One form of uncertainty, aleatory, cannot be 
					reduced by definition whereas with the other, epistemic, where uncertainty can be reduced 
					(see Chapter 3). However that reduction does not stop the original network from becoming 
					sub-optimal over time, pointing to the need to regularly reassess its performance. From 
					that perspective we see that the design criteria must allow for the possibility of ‘gauging’ 
					(adding monitors to) sites that</p>
                <ul, type="shape," align="left">
				  <li>Maximally reduce uncertainty at their space–time points (measuring their responses 
					  eliminates their uncertainty);</li>
				  <li>Best minimise uncertainty at other locations;</li>
				  <li>Best inform about process parameters;</li>
				  <li>Best detect non-compliers.</li>
				</ul,>
				<br>
				<p align="left">From this chapter, the reader will have gained an understanding of many of the 
					challenges that the network designer may face. These involve the following topics:</p>
                <ul, type="shape," align="left">
				  <li>A multiplicity of valid design objectives.</li>
				  <li>Unforeseen and changing objectives.</li>
				  <li>A multiplicity of responses at each site, i.e. which should be monitored.</li>
				  <li>A need to use prior knowledge and to characterise prior uncertainty.</li>
				  <li>A need to formulate realistic process models.</li>
				  <li>A requirement to take advantage of, and integrate with, existing networks.</li>
				  <li>The need to be realistic, meaning to contend with economic as well as administrative 
					  demands and constraints.</li>
                </ul,>
				<p></p>
				
				
				
				<h2><strong>Chapter 14: New frontiers</strong></h2>
				<hr style="background:#83d3c9; border:0; height:1px" />
				<p align="left">In this chapter the reader will have encountered a selection of new 
					frontiers in spatio– temporal epidemiology including the following:</p>
                <ul, type="shape," align="left">
				  <li>A number of areas that are currently under active development.</li>
				  <li>Two modern approaches to addressing the problem of non-stationarity in random spatio–
					  temporal fields; warping and dimension expansion.</li>
				  <li>How dimension expansion can be used to dramatically reduce non-stationarity and suggest 
					  its possible causes.</li>
				  <li>A powerful approach combining both physical and statistical modelling within a single 
					  framework.</li>
				</ul,>
